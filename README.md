📝 Project Description
Road Signs Detection is a Machine Learning and Computer Vision project that detects and classifies traffic signs from images and videos in real-time. This project is useful for autonomous vehicles, driver assistance systems, and road safety analytics.

The system leverages a pre-trained ML model and OpenCV to recognize various road signs like:

🚫 No Entry

🛑 Stop Sign

🚸 Pedestrian Crossing

⚠️ Warning Signs

🚦 Speed Limits

…and more!

🧠 Features
✅ Real-Time Traffic Sign Detection

✅ Trained ML Model and YOLOv8 usage

✅ OpenCV for Image Processing

✅ Streamlit Frontend for User Interaction

✅ Easy to Deploy and Extend
